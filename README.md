# Install

As of now you have to install the mod manually, but fear not it's coming to Thunderstore *soon*.

Download the latest version from release. Then unzip it and put the folder into BepinEX/plugin. If this is your first time modding the game then be sure to join Hollow Knight Modding Discord, install a mod manager and BepinEX and then come back.

> At this time we recommend using [r2modman](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases/latest/) or [gale](https://github.com/Kesomannen/gale/releases/latest/) to install mods.

> We are aware these currently don't have MacOS support, and for now MacOS users will need to manually install mods (see: MacOS FAQ). In the future we are planning to have dedicated Silksong Mod Installers, which will support all platforms that modding is supported on.

> If you you don't want to use an installer for some reason, you can find instructions linked on the Silksong version of Bepinex page: https://thunderstore.io/c/hollow-knight-silksong/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Silksong/.
